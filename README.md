# CHI-PG

As part of a machine learning course project, we replicated the article CHI-PG: Fast prototype generation algorithm for Big Data classification problems. A serial implementation of the algorithm was implemented in Python.

You can find the article [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231218300894) and their implementation [here](https://github.com/melkano/chi-pg).

### Structure:

`chi-pg/authors-code/` contains the original author's source code with some modifications to help debug it. The README inside presents a complete tutorial on how to setup and run their code (macOS).

`chi-pg/our-code/` contains our implementation of CHI-PG in Python and a demo folder to show how to use it.

`chi-pg/report/` stores some results produced by our implementation.

`chi-pg/serialized/` has some conveniences used during the implementation stages.
